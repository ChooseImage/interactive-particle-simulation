# Interactive Particle Simulation
This project uses Three.js for 3D rendering and user interaction. I made it over a summer weekend for fun. I went ahead and placed it under MIT License, so feel free to fork it and create an entirely new system using this one as a foundation. Happy Hacking!

# Notes
You will need to replace the Font Awesome kit in the Index HTML file head with your own kit.
