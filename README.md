# Interactive Particle Simulation
This project uses Three.js for 3D rendering and user interaction. I made it over a summer weekend for fun. I went ahead and placed it under MIT License, so feel free to fork it and create an entirely new system using this one as a foundation. Happy Hacking!

# Notes
You will need to replace the Font Awesome kit with your own, as well as the path to your audio file location for the background music.
Font Awesome import can be found in the index HTML file, between the opening and closing head tags.
Audio file import can be found in the main JavaScript file, in the initAudio method.
